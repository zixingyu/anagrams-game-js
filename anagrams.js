/**
 * This function will query the CS4640 server for a new target word. 
 *
 * It makes use of AJAX and Promises to await the result.  We won't discuss
 * promises in detail, so you're welcome to review this code for more
 * details.  However, essentially we need the browser to send an AJAX query
 * to our API and then wait for a reply.  If it just waits, then the browser
 * tab will appear to be frozen briefly while the HTTP request is taking place.
 * Therefore, we send the request with a Promise that awaits the results.  When
 * the response comes back from the server, the promise will return the result
 * to our getRandomWord() function and that will call your function.  This happens
 * asynchronously, so you should treat your function like you would an event
 * handler.

 * game, you should call this function as:
 *     getRandomWord(setUpNewGame);
